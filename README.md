With this I finish the HTML and CSS introduction from the courses I'm following. I feel pretty good, and I liked the learning process. I will probably stop making notes like these from now on, because I feel that what comes next will require more of my focus, and I really want to commit all the time and energy I have to this. These notes have been decent for self-reflection, but I don't think they're really necessary. I just wanna focus to learn as much as possible and actually start feeling like I'm employable at some point in the future. With that being said, I farewell my beginner notes :P
